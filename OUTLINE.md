## Project goals:
1. Produce reference-quality genome assemblies for various Bordetella species.
1. Look for rearrangement in genomes of other Bordetella species.
1. Identify functional contrains to rearrangement absent in *B. pertussis*.

## Project tasks:
1. Assemble genomes of various species
	+ *B. bronchiseptica*: 20
	+ *B. parapertussis*: 16
	+ *B. holmesii*: 16
	+ *B. hinzii*: 9
	+ *B. avium*: 8
1. Whole-genome alignment within each species.
	+ Identify rearrangements.
	+ Evaluate gene loss/gain.
1. Functional gene content comparison between species.
	+ Match orthologs and annotate variable gene functions.
1. Compare methylation motifs between species(?).
